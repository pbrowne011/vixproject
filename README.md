# Modeling the VIX using GARCH, ARIMA, Neural Nets, and Other Approaches
This project aims to model the VIX (Volatility Index) using various time series forecasting techniques, including GARCH, ARIMA, and neural nets. The VIX is a widely used indicator of the volatility of the stock market, and accurate forecasting of the VIX can provide valuable insights for investment decisions.

The first approach used for modeling the VIX is the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model, which is a popular model for modeling time-varying volatility. The GARCH model is trained on the training set of the data and evaluated on the testing set.

The second approach used is the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which is a popular time series forecasting model used in statistics and econometrics. The ARIMA model is trained on the training set of the data and evaluated on the testing set.

The third approach used is neural nets, specifically GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models. The GRU RNN model is trained on the training set of the data and evaluated on the testing set.

## Trading Algorithm
The second part of this project involves implementing a trading algorithm based on the predictions generated by the models. The trading algorithm will use the predictions to make decisions on whether to buy, sell, or hold the VIX (CBOE: VIX).

The trading algorithm will be backtested using historical data to evaluate its performance. The backtesting process involves simulating the performance of the trading algorithm using historical data to see how it would have performed in the past. This will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the algorithm and help refine its design and implementation.

## Possible Ideas

We plan to modify the project so that it invovles preprocessing the VIX data, including splitting it into training and testing sets, with the testing set reserved for evaluating the performance of the models.

## Goals
This project aims to develop a robust and accurate model for forecasting the VIX using various time series forecasting techniques. The project also involves developing a trading algorithm based on the predictions generated by the models. The project will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different modeling techniques and their applicability to real-world investment decisions.
